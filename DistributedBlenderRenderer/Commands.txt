These are the valid commands for the rendering server.
Since there isn't a defined standard for anything like this that I'm aware of, this is specific to this program.
Feel free to use this for your own programs if you wish.

Server Contexts:

11XX Codes: Introduction Codes

 - 1101 : Connection Confirmation
          This can be sent by the client or server.  When the server receives this, it means that there is a client attempting to establish a connection.
          If the connection is accepted, than the same code will be sent back to the client.

 - 1102 : Connection Refused
          In the event that the server receives a 1101, but is unwilling to register them, than the server will send a 1102 to refuse the connection, followed
          by a termination of the connection.

 - 1103 : Login Required
          This is sent when the server is willing to accept a client after they have sent an 1101, but they require a login for this current contest.  There 
          is not currently any support for logins to servers, but this is allocated for when it is allowed.  This code will also be sent after the username
          and then password are sent.  The interaction would go like this:

          Connection -> Client sends 1101 -> Server sends 1103 -> Client sends username -> Server sends 1103 -> Client sends password (hashed) -> Server sends either 1101 or 1102.

21XX Codes: Queue Codes

 - 2201 : Queue Joined
          This can be sent by the client or server.  When the server receives this, it means that the client (who has already been accepted) is requesting
          to join the ongoing queue.  If the server accepts, then 2201 will be sent to the client, and they will be able to receive frames from then on.

 - 2202 : Queue Join Refused
          In the event the server is unwilling to allow the client to enter the queue at the current time.  They can try again, but they are not currently in the queue.

31XX Codes: Stream Codes

 - 3101 : File Request
          This is sent by the server to all clients that are currently in the queue when they wish to send a .blend file.  This file would be used to create
          the frames for later requests.  A project UUID is also sent.

          The client can also send this in order to send their rendered frame back to the server.

          Server sends 3101 -> Client sends 3101 (accept) -> Server sends .blend file -> Client sends 3101 -> Server sends UUID

 - 3102 : File Refuse
          This si sent by the server when it is unwilling to receive a frame.  There can be any reason for this, but the most likely is that the client is
          attempting to send a file that the server is not expecting, e.g. the client wants to send a frame but the server never asked them to render one.

 - 3103 : Render Request
          This is sent by the server to the client when they want the client to render a frame.  The transaction goes like this:

          Server sends 3103 -> Client sends 3103 -> Server sends project UUID -> Client sends 3103 (if they have that file) -> Server sends frame -> Client sends 3103

 - 3104 : Render Refuse
          This is sent by the client and server.  The client sends this when the client is not willing to render.  The server can send this as a response to say
          'We hear you, and we will not ask again.  You are still part of the queue'.  Otherwise, they would say 2202, to signify a termination of queue.

 - 3105 : Finished
          This is sent when either a file send request or render request is finished and approved.

41XX Codes: Error Codes

 - 4101 : Invalid Command
          Sent by either client or server when the command that was sent previously was not recognized.

Other Codes:

 - {DBRENDOFFILESEQUENCE} : Sent in order to indicate that the file has finished being sent.
